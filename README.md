# PoseLib
This library provides a collection of minimal solvers for camera pose estimation. The focus is on calibrated absolute pose estimation problems from different types of correspondences (e.g. point-point, point-line, line-point, line-line).

The goals of this project are
* Fast and robust implementation of the current state-of-the-art solvers.
* Consistent calling interface between different solvers.
* Minimize dependencies, both external (currently only [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)) and internal. Each solver is (mostly) stand-alone, making it easy to extract only a specific solver to integrate into other frameworks.


## Naming convention
For the solver names we use a slightly non-standard notation where we denote the solver as

<pre>
p<b><i>X</i></b>p<b><i>Y</i></b>pl<b><i>Z</i></b>lp<b><i>W</i></b>ll
</pre>

where the number of correspondences required is given by
* <b><i>X</i></b>p - 2D point to 3D point,
* <b><i>Y</i></b>pl - 2D point to 3D line,
* <b><i>Z</i></b>lp - 2D line to 3D point,
* <b><i>W</i></b>ll - 2D line to 2D line.

The prefix with `u` is for upright solvers and  `g` for generalized camera solvers. Solvers that estimate focal length have the postfix with `f` and similarly `s` for solvers that estimate scale.

## Calling conventions
All solvers return their solutions as a vector of `CameraPose` structs, which defined as
```
struct CameraPose {
   Eigen::Matrix3d R;
   Eigen::Vector3d t;
   double alpha = 1.0; // either focal length or scale
};
```
where `[R t]` maps from the world coordinate system into the camera coordinate system.


For <b>2D point to 3D point</b> correspondences, the image points are represented as unit-length bearings vectors. The returned camera poses `(R,t)` then satisfies (for some `lambda`)
```
  lambda * x[i] = R * X[i] + t
```
where `x[i]` is the 2D point and `X[i]` is the 3D point.
<b>Note</b> that only the P3P solver filters solutions with negative `lambda`.

Solvers that use point-to-point constraints take one vector with bearing vectors `x` and one vector with the corresponding 3D points `X`, e.g. for the P3P solver the function declaration is

```
int p3p(const std::vector<Eigen::Vector3d> &x,
        const std::vector<Eigen::Vector3d> &X,
        std::vector<CameraPose> *output);
```
Each solver returns the number of real solutions found.

For constraints with <b>2D lines</b>, the lines are represented in homogeneous coordinates. In the case of 2D line to 3D point constraints, the returned camera poses then satisfies
```
  l[i].transpose() * (R * X[i] + t) = 0
```
where `l[i]` is the line and  `X[i]` is the 3D point.

For constraints with <b>3D lines</b>, the lines are represented by a 3D point `X` and a bearing vector `V`. In the case of 2D point to 3D point constraints
```
  lambda * x[i] = R * (X[i] + mu * V[i]) + t
```
for some values of `lambda` and `mu`. Similarly, for line to line constraints we have
```
  l[i].transpose() * (R * (X[i] + mu * V[i]) + t) = 0
```
### Generalized Cameras
For generalized cameras we represent the image rays similarly to the 3D lines above, with an offset `p` and a bearing vector `x`. For example, in the case of point-to-point correspondences we have
```
p[i] + lambda * x[i] = R * X[i] + t
```
In the case of unknown scale we also estimate `alpha` such that
```
alpha * p[i] + lambda * x[i] = R * X[i] + t
```
For example, the generalized pose and scale solver (from four points) has the following signature
```
 int gp4ps(const std::vector<Eigen::Vector3d> &p, const std::vector<Eigen::Vector3d> &x,
              const std::vector<Eigen::Vector3d> &X, std::vector<CameraPose> *output);
```

### Upright Solvers
For the upright solvers it assumed that the rotation is around the y-axis, i.e.
```
R = [a 0 -b; 0 1 0; b 0 a] 
```
To use these solvers it necessary to pre-rotate the input such that this is satisfied.
