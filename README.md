# PoseLib
This library provides a collection of minimal solvers for camera pose estimation. The focus is on calibrated absolute pose estimation problems from different types of correspondences (e.g. point-point, point-line, line-point, line-line).

The goals of this project are to provide
* Fast and robust implementation of the current state-of-the-art solvers.
* Consistent calling interface between different solvers.
* Minimize dependencies, both external (currently only [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)) and internal. Each solver is (mostly) stand-alone, making it easy to extract only a specific solver to integrate into other frameworks.
* Robust estimators (based on LO-RANSAC) that just works out-of-the-box for most cases.

# Robust Estimation and Non-linear Refinement
We provide robust estimators for the most common problems
* Absolute pose from points (and lines)
* Essential / Fundamental matrix
* Homography
* Generalized relative pose

It is fairly straight-forward to implement robust estimators for other problems. See for example [absolute_pose.h](PoseLib/robust/estimators/absolute_pose.h). If you implement estimators for other problems, please consider submitting a pull-request.

In [robust.h](PoseLib/robust.h) we provide interfaces which normalizes the data, calls the RANSAC and runs a post-RANSAC non-linear refinement. It is also possible to directly call the individual components as well (see e.g. [ransac.h](PoseLib/robust/ransac.h), [bundle.h](PoseLib/robust/bundle.h), etc.). The RANSAC is straight-forward implementation of LO-RANSAC which generate hypothesis with minimal solvers and relies on non-linear refinement for refitting.

The robust estimator takes the following options
```c++
struct RansacOptions {
    size_t max_iterations = 100000;
    size_t min_iterations = 1000;
    double dyn_num_trials_mult = 3.0;
    double success_prob = 0.9999;
    double max_reproj_error = 12.0;  // used for 2D-3D matches
    double max_epipolar_error = 1.0; // used for 2D-2D matches
    unsigned long seed = 0;
    // If we should use PROSAC sampling. Assumes data is sorted
    bool progressive_sampling = false;
    size_t max_prosac_iterations = 100000;
    // Whether to use real focal length checking for F estimation: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16304
    // Assumes that principal points of both cameras are at origin.
    bool real_focal_check = false;
};
```
and the non-linear refinement 
```c++
struct BundleOptions {
    size_t max_iterations = 100;
    enum LossType {
        TRIVIAL, TRUNCATED, HUBER, CAUCHY, TRUNCATED_LE_ZACH
    } loss_type = LossType::CAUCHY;
    double loss_scale = 1.0;
    double gradient_tol = 1e-8;
    double step_tol = 1e-8;
    double initial_lambda = 1e-3;
    double min_lambda = 1e-10;
    double max_lambda = 1e10;
    bool verbose = false;
};
```
Note that in [robust.h](PoseLib/robust.h) this is only used for the post-RANSAC refinement.

In [bundle.h](PoseLib/robust/bundle.h) we provide non-linear refinement for different problems. Mainly minimizing reprojection error and Sampson error as these performed best in our internal evaluations. These are used in the LO-RANSAC to perform non-linear refitting. Most estimators directly minimize the MSAC score (using `loss_type = TRUNCATED` and `loss_scale = threshold`) over all input correspondences. In practice we found that this works quite well and avoids recursive LO where inliers are added in steps.

## Camera models
PoseLib use [COLMAP](https://colmap.github.io/cameras.html)-compatible camera models. These are defined in [colmap_models.h](PoseLib/misc/colmap_models.h). Currently we only support
* SIMPLE_PINHOLE
* PINHOLE
* SIMPLE_RADIAL
* RADIAL
* OPENCV

but it is relatively straight-forward to add other models. If you do so please consider opening a pull-request. In contrast to COLMAP, we require analytical jacobians for the distortion mappings which make it a bit more work to port them.

The `Camera` struct currently contains `width`/`height` fields, however these are not used anywhere in the code-base and are provided simply to be consistent with COLMAP. The `Camera` class also provides the helper function `initialize_from_txt(str)` which initializes the camera from a line given by the `cameras.txt` file of a COLMAP reconstruction. 

The python bindings also expose the `poselib.Camera` class with `focal(), focal_x(), focal_y(), model_name(), prinicipal_point()` read-only methods and a read-write `params` property, but currently this is only used as a return type for some methods. To supply camera information to robust estimators you should use python `dicts` as shown below.

## Python bindings
The python bindings can be installed by running `pip install .`. The python bindings expose all minimal solvers, e.g. `poselib.p3p(x,X)`, as well as all robust estimators from [robust.h](PoseLib/robust.h). 

Examples of how the robust estimators can be called are
```python
camera = {'model': 'SIMPLE_PINHOLE', 'width': 1200, 'height': 800, 'params': [960, 600, 400]}

pose, info = poselib.estimate_absolute_pose(p2d, p3d, camera, {'max_reproj_error': 16.0}, {})
```
or
```python
F, info = poselib.estimate_fundamental_matrix(p2d_1, p2d_2, {'max_epipolar_error': 0.75, 'progressive_sampling': True}, {})

```

The return value `info` is a dict containing information about the robust estimation (inliers, iterations, etc). The last two options are dicts which describe the `RansacOptions` and `BundleOptions`. Ommited values are set to their default (see above), except for the `loss_scale` used for the Cauchy loss which is set to half of the threshold used in RANSAC (which seems to be a good heuristic). Dicts with the default options can be obtained as `opt = poselib.RansacOptions()` or `poselib.BundleOptions()`.



Some of the available estimators are listed below, check [pyposelib.cpp](pybind/pyposelib.cpp) and [robust.h](PoseLib/robust.h) for more details. The table also shows which error threshold is used in the estimation (`RansacOptions.max_reproj_error` or `RansacOptions.max_epipolar_error`). All thresholds are given in pixels.

### Storing poses and estimated camera parameters
To handle poses and cameras we provide the following classes: 

- `CameraPose`: This class is the return type for the most of the methods. While the class internally represent the pose with `q` and `t`, it also exposes `R` (3x3) and `Rt` (3x4) which are read/write, i.e. you can do `pose.R = Rnew` and it will update the underlying quaternion `q`.
- `Image`: Following COLMAP, this class stores information about the camera (`image.camera`) and its pose (`image.pose`) used to take an image.
- `ImagePair`: This class holds information about two cameras (`image_pair.camera1`, `image_pair.camera2`) and their relative pose (`image_pair.pose`). This class is used as the return type for the `estimate_shared_focal_relative_pose` robust estimator.

All of these are also exposed via python bindings as: `poselib.CameraPose, poselib.Image, poselib.ImagePair`.

### Benchmarking the robust estimators
To sanity-check the robust estimators we benchmark against the LO-RANSAC implementation from [pycolmap](https://github.com/colmap/pycolmap).
    
<a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48490995/149815304-b3c1049a-ee64-4c14-be60-d4930535a3e7.png"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48490995/149815304-b3c1049a-ee64-4c14-be60-d4930535a3e7.png" width="75%"></a>
    
For all of the metrics higher is better (except for runtime).

# Minimal Solvers
## Naming convention
For the solver names we use a slightly non-standard notation where we denote the solver as

<pre>
p<b><i>X</i></b>p<b><i>Y</i></b>pl<b><i>Z</i></b>lp<b><i>W</i></b>ll
</pre>

where the number of correspondences required is given by
* <b><i>X</i></b>p - 2D point to 3D point,
* <b><i>Y</i></b>pl - 2D point to 3D line,
* <b><i>Z</i></b>lp - 2D line to 3D point,
* <b><i>W</i></b>ll - 2D line to 3D line.

The prefix with `u` is for upright solvers and  `g` for generalized camera solvers. Solvers that estimate focal length have the postfix with `f` and similarly `s` for solvers that estimate scale.

## Calling conventions
All solvers return their solutions as a vector of `CameraPose` structs, which defined as
```c++
struct CameraPose {
   Eigen::Vector4d q;
   Eigen::Vector3d t;
};
```
where the rotation is representation as a quaternion `q` and the convention is that `[R t]` maps from the world coordinate system into the camera coordinate system.


For <b>2D point to 3D point</b> correspondences, the image points are represented as unit-length bearings vectors. The returned camera poses `(R,t)` then satisfies (for some `lambda`)
```c++
  lambda * x[i] = R * X[i] + t
```
where `x[i]` is the 2D point and `X[i]` is the 3D point.
<b>Note</b> that only the P3P solver filters solutions with negative `lambda`.

Solvers that use point-to-point constraints take one vector with bearing vectors `x` and one vector with the corresponding 3D points `X`, e.g. for the P3P solver the function declaration is

```c++
int p3p(const std::vector<Eigen::Vector3d> &x,
        const std::vector<Eigen::Vector3d> &X,
        std::vector<CameraPose> *output);
```
Each solver returns the number of real solutions found.

For constraints with <b>2D lines</b>, the lines are represented in homogeneous coordinates. In the case of 2D line to 3D point constraints, the returned camera poses then satisfies
```c++
  l[i].transpose() * (R * X[i] + t) = 0
```
where `l[i]` is the line and  `X[i]` is the 3D point.

For constraints with <b>3D lines</b>, the lines are represented by a 3D point `X` and a bearing vector `V`. In the case of 2D point to 3D point constraints
```c++
  lambda * x[i] = R * (X[i] + mu * V[i]) + t
```
for some values of `lambda` and `mu`. Similarly, for line to line constraints we have
```c++
  l[i].transpose() * (R * (X[i] + mu * V[i]) + t) = 0
```
### Generalized Cameras
For generalized cameras we represent the image rays similarly to the 3D lines above, with an offset `p` and a bearing vector `x`. For example, in the case of point-to-point correspondences we have
```c++
p[i] + lambda * x[i] = R * X[i] + t
```
In the case of unknown scale we also estimate `alpha` such that
```c++
alpha * p[i] + lambda * x[i] = R * X[i] + t
```
For example, the generalized pose and scale solver (from four points) has the following signature
```c++
 int gp4ps(const std::vector<Eigen::Vector3d> &p, const std::vector<Eigen::Vector3d> &x,
              const std::vector<Eigen::Vector3d> &X, std::vector<CameraPose> *output);
```

### Upright Solvers
For the upright solvers it assumed that the rotation is around the y-axis, i.e.
```c++
R = [a 0 -b; 0 1 0; b 0 a] 
```
To use these solvers it necessary to pre-rotate the input such that this is satisfied.

## Implemented solvers
The following solvers are currently implemented.

## Decompositions

Poselib also provides methods for decomposing fundamental matrices to obtain the focal lengths of the cameras.

| Method | Arguments | Output | Comment |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| <sub>`focals_from_fundamental` </sub> | <sub>`(F, pp1, pp2)`</sub> | <sub>`(cam1, cam2)`</sub> | Bougnoux (ICCV 1998) |
| <sub>`focals_from_fundamental_iterative`</sub> | <sub>`(F, cam1_prior, cam2_prior, max_iters = 50, weights = {5e-4, 1.0, 5e-4, 1.0})`</sub> | <sub>`(cam1, cam2, iters)`</sub> | Kocur et al. (CVPR 2024) |

Both of the methods also have python bindings. To obtain the focal lengths from the camera object you can use `focal = cam.focal()`. Note that both of these methods can produce very inaccurate results and fail often such that the output focal lengths can be NaNs or negative numbers. If you need to estimate a focal length shared by both cameras (e.g. the same camera in both views) you should use `estimate_shared_focal_relative_pose`.
