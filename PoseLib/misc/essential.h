Factorizes the essential matrix into the relative poses. Assumes that the essential matrix corresponds to
planar motion, i.e. that we have

           e10  0  e12;

Only returns the solution where the rotation is on the form
     R = [a 0 -b;
         0  1  0;
         b  0  a];
Note that there is another solution where the rotation is on the form
     R = [a 0   b;
         0  -1  0;
         b  0  -a];
which is not returned!

The method also takes one point correspondence that is used to filter for cheirality.
